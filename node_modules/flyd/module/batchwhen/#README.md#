# flyd-batchwhen

Batches values from the second stream while the first stream is
true. When the first stream is true, it will send a batch of all
events from the first stream that have occured while the first stream
was true. If an event from the second stream occurs while the first
stream is false, it will be dispatched as a single element batch.

# Usage

```js
var action$ = flyd.stream()
var throttle$ = flyd.stream(false)
var batchedAction$ = flyd.batchWhen(throttle$, action$)

action$(1)
// batchedAction$ => [1]
action$(2)
// batchedAction$ => [2]
throttle$(true)
action$(3)
action$(4)
throttle$(false)
// batchedAction$ => [3, 4]
throttle$(true)
throttle$(false)
```
